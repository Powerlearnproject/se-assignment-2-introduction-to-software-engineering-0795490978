 Improved Quality:
        Accurate requirements lead to the development of high-quality software that performs as expected, with fewer defects and issues.

   Software Design Principles

   Separation of Concerns:

   Divide the software into distinct sections, each addressing a specific concern or functionality. This simplifies development and maintenance.

Modularity:
    Design the software in modular units or components that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

Abstraction:
    Hide the complex implementation details behind simpler interfaces, making the system easier to use and understand.

Encapsulation:
    Bundle data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
    Ensure that each module or class is responsible for only one functionality or concern, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
    Design modules that are open for extension but closed for modification, allowing new functionality to be added without altering existing code.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
    Ensure that derived classes can be substituted for their base classes without affecting the correctness of the program.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
    Create specific interfaces for different clients, rather than a single general-purpose interface, reducing the impact of changes.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
    Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, promoting decoupling and flexibility.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
ANS

Modularity in Software Design

Modularity is a design principle in software engineering where a system is divided into separate, self-contained units called modules

Benefits of Modularity
1. Improved Maintainability:

    Isolation of Changes: When a change is needed, only the relevant module needs to be modified, reducing the risk of introducing bugs in other parts of the system.
    Easier Debugging and Testing: Testing and debugging are more straightforward because each module can be tested independently.
    Code Reusability: Modules can be reused across different projects or in different parts of the same project, reducing redundancy and development time.
    Clearer Organization: Code is more organized and readable, making it easier for new developers to understand and contribute to the project.

2. Enhanced Scalability:

    Independent Development: Teams can work on different modules simultaneously without interfering with each other, speeding up the development process.
    Flexible Expansion: New features can be added by creating new modules or extending existing ones without overhauling the entire system.
    Load Distribution: In a distributed system, modules can be deployed across multiple servers or instances, improving load management and performance.

        Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

 Tracking Changes:
        Every change is tracked with details about who made the change, when, and why, providing a complete history of the project.

 Branching and Merging:
        Developers can create branches to work on features or fixes independently and merge them back into the main codebase once they're ready.

 Backup and Restore:
        The entire history of the project is stored, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.

  Conflict Resolution:
        VCS help manage and resolve conflicts that arise when multiple developers make changes to the same part of the code.

 Audit Trail:
        Provides a detailed record of changes, facilitating accountability and transparency.

   Continuous Integration and Deployment:
        Integration with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.
